## Practice Guidelines

### For Each Scenario:
1. **Start Simple**: Implement basic functionality first
2. **Add Features**: Gradually add complexity and edge cases
3. **Write Tests**: Create comprehensive test suites
4. **Optimize**: Profile and optimize performance
5. **Document**: Add clear documentation and examples

### Recommended Approach:
1. Read the scenario carefully
2. Design the data structures and interfaces
3. Implement core functionality
4. Add error handling and edge cases
5. Write unit and integration tests
6. Benchmark and optimize if needed
7. Add documentation and examples

### Skills Development Focus:
- **Beginner**: Focus on syntax, basic concepts, and simple problem-solving
- **Intermediate**: Emphasize design patterns, error handling, and testing
- **Advanced**: Concentrate on concurrency, performance, and system design
- **Expert**: Master reflection, advanced patterns, and production-ready code

Each scenario is designed to reinforce specific Go concepts while solving real-world problems. Start with scenarios matching your current skill level and gradually progress to more complex challenges.
